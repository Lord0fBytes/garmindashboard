This will be the future home for my Garmin Dashboard site.  
Hopefully this will allow people to log into their Garmin Connect account and create a pretty dashboard of information including the main focus which will be a heat map of activities  
Caution to anyone wanting to use this:  
Data that this application pulls will contain very personal data including, but not limited to:
  - GPS location data of activities
  - Device information (names and type)
  - Personal information (Name, username, password (encrypted))
  - Activity metrics (run times, types of activities)

I do not store anything from the data pulled. I will have scripts that clean the data as soon as you leave the session. \\
You will have the ability to download the data for personal use and manually delete it from the server. \\

If any of this sketches you out then be gone, no hard feelings. \\

This is just a fun project I am making for some friends and have no intensions on storing or sharing any data. \\

If you are still unsure feel free to look at my project page on Github where you can see in the code where I remove everything and encrypt information. \\

Thanks!\\
